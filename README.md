# Dotfiles

Just my dotfiles. Soon I will update the repository with screenshots.

**The script was made for use on Arch Linux, if you are going to use it in another distro, edit the install packages block in the file [install.sh](install.sh#L16)**

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sirius-red/dotfiles.git --depth 1
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Or one line command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sirius-red/dotfiles.git --depth 1 && cd dotfiles && ./install.sh
```
